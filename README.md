# Algorithms collection UNIPI.

Repository containing a collection of algorithms covered during the Programming and Algorithms course in the first year of Computer Science. The collection of algorithms is written either in javascript or in C ++, and each of them is associated with a description of how it works together with the description of the calculation of complexity.
